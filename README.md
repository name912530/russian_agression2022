# russian-ukrainian-war2022

On 24 February 2022, Russia began a military invasion of Ukraine in a major escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict that had begun in 2014. It is the largest military attack in Europe since World War II

Russia says that it only attacks military targets, but this is completely untrue. This repository contains photo evidence (a very small part of them) that Russian artillery and aircraft are destroying civilian infrastructure and civilian homes in Ukraine
